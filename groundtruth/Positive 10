In "Who Can Defeat Bill Clinton?" (column, Feb. 13), A. M. Rosenthal crafts an insightful sentence: "Mr. Clinton's danger is that he will lose the undecided who can accept an <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>occasionally inconsistent <HR>President</HR></RP> but not a consistently inconstant one."

In a 1993 speech in Chillicothe, Ohio, <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> Clinton</RP> said: "Very few Americans believe that all abortions all the time are all right. 

If signed by <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>the <HR>President</HR></RP>, the bill would outlaw a horrible method for killing viable, late-term children (Mr. Clinton's word).

Yet despite the support for this bill, <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> Clinton</RP> has vowed to veto it.

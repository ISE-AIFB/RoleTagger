The votes are in, and the winner for best performer in the role of <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>former <HR>President</HR> Bill Clinton</RP> is: Bill Clinton.

Jacob Bronstein, who with Dan Zitt produced and directed the abridged version, said that while directing requires assertiveness, with Mr. Clinton "it was more difficult to assert myself than with a regular Broadway actor." Mr. Bronstein said feedback went something like: "<RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>Mr. <HR>President</HR></RP>, can you move closer to the mike?" Or, "This is an important passage, <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>Mr. <HR>President</HR></RP>; maybe you can try to imbue it with some of that feeling you were using in Chapter 2?"

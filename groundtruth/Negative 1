Omega Pope, an attendant at a state hospital for 30 years, opened the home in a 1930's-era house in 1970. Twenty people between the ages of 47 and 88 live there, supervised mainly by Mrs. Pope and her daughter, Romaine Powell.

Mrs. Pope says she is proud of her home. "These people come here to be innovated and live at the highest level they can."

"I don't know," Mrs. Pope said. "The man's in the hospital with pneumonia." 

"It's broken," Mrs. Pope said.

"This does need replacing," said Mrs. Pope. 

"The plumber's coming back soon," Mrs. Pope said. 

"We know that," Mrs. Pope and her daughter said in unison. 

"We talk to them constantly," said Mrs. Pope, sending for an aide to clean the bureau. 

"All this humidity," said Mrs. Pope. 

"He likes them on the floor," said Mrs. Pope. 

"I'll ask if he flosses," Mrs. Pope said. 

Towels? "We have no towels out right now," Mrs. Pope said.

"Looks like Mellaril," an antipsychotic, Mrs. Pope said. 

"We have more on order," said Mrs. Pope. "We're defrosting," said Mrs. Pope.

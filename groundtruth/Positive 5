A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said yesterday that <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'><HR>QUEEN</HR> ELIZABETH II</RP> and other members of the royal family are discussing possible changes in Britain's 1,200-year-old monarchy. The palace refused to specify what issues <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the 70-year-old <HR>queen</HR></RP>, her husband, <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'><HR>PRINCE</HR> PHILIP</RP>, and the heir to the throne, <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'><HR>PRINCE</HR> CHARLES</RP>, have taken up in their talks with senior aides.

The Sun said the discussions could lead to the end of payments from the public purse to <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>Queen</HR></RP>, her husband and <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'><HR>QUEEN</HR> ELIZABETH</RP> <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>Queen</HR> Mother</RP>.

Instead of the public payments, they would want the $142 million a year in revenue generated by <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>Crown</HR></RP> Estates, which <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'><HR>King</HR> George III</RP> surrendered in 1760, the newspaper said. 

The Sun reported that the royal family is also considering proposals to remove <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>monarch</HR> as temporal head of the Church of England</RP>, and to give women equal rights as heirs to the throne. 

Currently, <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>monarch</HR></RP> is succeeded by his or her eldest son, whose own son is next in line for the throne before any of his sisters.

Younger sons and their children are next in line, followed by any daughters of <RP Category='MONARCH_TAG'>the <HR>monarch</HR></RP>.

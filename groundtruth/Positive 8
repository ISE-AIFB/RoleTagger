Pouring water on a potted olive tree, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'><HR>Pope</HR> John Paul II</RP> prayed today for peace and forgiveness in the Middle East in a shattered city on the Golan Heights that is mainly a symbol of irreconcilable conflict.

The pocked streets surrounding the church where he prayed were crowded with thousands of Syrians brought by bus to greet <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP>. 

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP> prayed that believers would ''find the courage to forgive one another so that the wounds of the past may be healed, and not be a pretext for further suffering in the present.''

But his very presence in Quneitra provided a striking showcase for the Syrian government's efforts to portray <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> as their ally against Israel. 

Syrian television covered the visit live, frequently cutting away from <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> to broadcast lingering close-ups of concrete rubble.

Weak and visibly tired, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the 80-year-old <HR>pope</HR></RP> prayed on his knees inside the battered shell of an Orthodox church, one of the few buildings still standing, and addressed the news that a baby was killed this morning by Israeli tanks firing at a Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.

''Mindful of the sad news of conflict and death that even today arrives from Gaza,'' <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> said in remarks added to his prepared text, ''our prayers become even more intense.''

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP> was greeted by children holding up banners that signaled the political importance of his presence. 

In his travels <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> has always had to weave his message through the political agendas of his hosts, whether it was Gen. 

Augusto Pinochet in 1987 rearranging the schedule in Chile so he could pose on a balcony alongside <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP>, or Fidel Castro placing a portrait of Che Guevara above the altar where <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> offered a Mass in Cuba in 1998.

The last time <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> was in the Middle East -- on another biblical pilgrimage, which took him to Israel and the Palestinian terrorities last year -- each side tried to use his presence as an implicit seal of approval for its claim to Jerusalem as a capital.

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP>, who feels he has the moral authority to transcend local political agendas, stuck to his message, unfazed by manipulative moments and ungracious statements on both sides.

The Vatican took no public note in Syria of <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> Bashar al-Assad</RP>'s harsh statements seeking to portray Israel as the natural enemy of Christianity. 

At a Mass in a Damascus sports arena on Saturday, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> instead urged Christians, Muslims and Jews to work together to combat intolerance.

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP> is on a six-day pilgrimage retracing the Apostle Paul's steps in Greece, Syria and Malta. 

"<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP>'s coming here means he supports our rights as Syrians and Arabs," said Metropolitan Saba Esper, a Syrian Orthodox cleric who was one of <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP>'s hosts. 

The church where <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> prayed is shattered and empty, but its walls carry a two-page testimony by its <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>former <HR>bishop</HR></RP>, the Rev. George Muhassa, who said the destruction reminded him of Hiroshima.

Vatican aides appeared irritated by implications that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP>'s visit was being manipulated by his hosts. 

On Sunday, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>John Paul became the first <HR>pope</HR> to visit a mosque</RP>. 

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP>, who turns 81 this month and whose ailments include tremors associated with Parkinson's disease, seemed wearied by the first four days of an arduous trip.

At the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, and again today in Quneitra, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> read only a few paragraphs of his prepared prayer, letting an Arab translator deliver the bulk of his text.

On Tuesday <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>pope</HR></RP> goes to Malta, where Paul was shipwrecked. 

It will be John Paul's third visit there. <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>pope</HR></RP> might have a chance to rest a little on that overwhelmingly Roman Catholic island before returning to Rome on Wednesday.

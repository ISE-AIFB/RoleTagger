<RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> Clinton</RP> greeted the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys for the third time at the White House today and picked up a casual endorsement from the team owner, Jerry Jones.

"Ever since Bill Clinton got elected <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> of the United States</RP>, the Dallas Cowboys have been winning Super Bowls," said Jones, whose team also won the title in 1993 and 1994.

The Atlanta Braves, who won their first World Series last fall, will get a belated White House meeting with <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>the <HR>President</HR></RP> on Feb. 26. Officials said that Bosnian peace negotiations and the battle over the Federal budget had delayed the customary post-World Series meeting between <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>the <HR>President</HR></RP> and the winning team.

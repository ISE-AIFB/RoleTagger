Angela Merkel on Sunday accused <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>Chancellor</HR> Gerhard Schröder</RP> of saddling the country with record high unemployment and a faltering economy as they met in a televised debate two weeks before the election. 

Most polls predict that voters will make <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>Mrs. Merkel the first woman in German history to serve as <HR>chancellor</HR></RP>.

''<RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>The <HR>chancellor</HR></RP> also took note of the criticism of the United States government's relief effort in New Orleans, saying that the inadequate response illustrates why he thinks the state must continue to play a strong role here.

But Mrs. Merkel kept the focus on <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>the <HR>chancellor</HR></RP>'s economic record, noting that the number of jobless rose to more than five million during Mr. Schröder term, a record for the post-World War II period. 

In either case, Mrs. Merkel, 51, would replace Mr. Schröder, 61, as <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>chancellor</HR></RP>.

Mrs. Merkel said that if she became <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>chancellor</HR></RP>, she would be an example to other German women. 

<RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'>The <HR>chancellor</HR></RP> said Mrs. Merkel ''misunderstood'' the geopolitical importance of binding Turkey to Europe, to prevent it from the possibility of sliding into Islamic militancy. 

Mr. Schröder, on the other hand, noted that <RP Category='HEAD_OF_STATE_TAG'><HR>President</HR> Bush</RP> had described the rescue effort as ''unacceptable.''

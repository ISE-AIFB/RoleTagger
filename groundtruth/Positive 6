ROME, Aug. 23â€” The Vatican insisted today that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'><HR>Pope</HR> John Paul II</RP> was making excellent progress during a vacation in the mountains of northern Italy, despite concern over his health and questions about the potential hazards of the visit he plans to Sarajevo.

The worries about <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the 74-year-old <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s physical well-being resurfaced on Sunday when he seemed to grimace in pain while descending from a platform after he had said Mass.

At the time, his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> had inadvertently put all his weight on his right leg, which was injured last April when he fell in his bathroom at the Vatican. 

While <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s leg is clinically healed from the operation, Mr. Navarro-Valls said, he still has difficulty walking and usually places more weight on his uninjured left leg. 

The explanation did little to prevent a renewed series of press reports here suggesting that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s health was worse than the Vatican was prepared to acknowledge.

In the last two years, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>, who survived a 1981 assassination attempt, has undergone surgery to remove a large tumor from his intestines and dislocated his right shoulder when he tripped while descending from his throne during an audience last November.

The Vatican has vigorously denied reports suggesting that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> suffers from blackouts and that his health problems relate to Parkinson's disease or bone marrow cancer.

Although <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> began his annual mountain holiday last week looking pale and tired, Mr. Navarro-Valls again rejected suggestions that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> was sick, describing him as "basically healthy, strong and vigorous."

Since then, the Vatican has issued daily bulletins chronicling <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s walks in the mountains as evidence of his well-being. 

Confirming the excellent recovery of <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Holy Father</HR></RP>, his mountain excursions are continuing, Vatican Radio said today, reporting that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> had pressed himself to take longer walks.

The Vatican has insisted, moreover, that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'><HR>Pope</HR> John Paul II</RP> is still planning to visit Sarajevo on Sept. 

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>Pope</HR></RP> is planning to deliver a speech at the Bosnian capital's Olympic skating stadium. 

The idea of <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> visiting a city where his plane could be shot down or he himself could come under direct fire has drawn concern from United Nations officials, particularly since Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, has said <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s safety cannot be guaranteed.

While <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> has frequently inveighed against the bloodletting in the former Yugoslavia, he has not physically visited the Balkan war zones, where fighting has been under way for more than three years. 

Vatican officials have balanced their forecasts that the visit to Sarajevo will go ahead with hints that it could be called off at the last moment if <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> feels his audience in the stadium is at risk. 

The only way <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> could enter Sarajevo by air would be along the flight path used by United Nations relief flights, which are frequently suspended because of antiaircraft fire. 

Mr. Karazdic has suggested that the Muslim-led Bosnian Government forces could try to shoot down <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s plane and then blame the Bosnian Serbs. 

And once he is in the city, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>, who is considered by many Serbs to have supported their adversaries, would be in range of sniper fire.

Mr. Navarro-Valls, <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s spokesman, sought to rule out the idea that, if the Sarajevo trip was canceled, it would be because of <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s poor health.

That leg, which by the way is clinically healed, will not be the thing which prevents <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> from going to Sarajevo, he said today.

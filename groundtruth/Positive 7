Francesco Crucitti, who performed emergency surgery on <RP Category='POPE_TAG'><HR>Pope</HR> John Paul II</RP> after an assassination attempt in 1981 and went on to become his personal surgeon, died in Rome today.

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>Pope</HR></RP>, who had come into Rome today from his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo for a regular weekly audience, later traveled to Dr. Crucitti's home near the center of the city to offer condolences to his widow, Alessandra, and the couple's three children.

<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>Pope</HR></RP> said he had come ''to show you in some way my appreciation for this man who saved my life.''

Dr. Crucitti had last operated on <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> in 1996, when he performed a 50-minute operation at the Catholic University Agostino Gemelli Hospital, on the edge of Rome, to remove <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR>'s</RP> appendix. 

Four years earlier, when John Paul was 72, Dr. Crucitti performed an operation of almost four hours to excise a large tumor from <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR>'s</RP> colon and to remove his gall bladder.

But the most dramatic moment in Dr. Crucitti's career came in May 1981, when he was called on to perform almost six hours of emergency surgery on <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> after a bullet fired by a gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca of Turkey, perforated <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR>'s</RP> abdominal cavity. 

Later that year, Dr. Crucitti operated on <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> to restore the normal functioning of his intestines by reversing a colostomy performed on the day of the shooting.

Dr. Crucitti, who headed one of the Gemelli Hospital's three surgical units at the time, had been examining patients in a nearby hospital when a nun told him that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> had been shot. 

On the way to the Gemelli Hospital, where <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> had been taken by ambulance from the scene of the shooting at the Vatican, Dr. Crucitti is said to have stopped a policeman to ask for an escort, pleading, ''I am the surgeon who will operate on <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>.''

In a long interview with The New York Times, Dr. Crucitti later recalled that he had worked at a hectic pace, first to stop <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s internal bleeding, then to repair the extensive damage done to his intestines. 

''<RP Category='POPE_TAG'>The <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s blood pressure was dropping rapidly,'' Dr. Crucitti said, ''but he was not in shock.''

At a news conference after the operation, Dr. Crucitti described <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s condition as grave.

It was the first time in this century that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>a <HR>pope</HR></RP> had been treated outside the Vatican.

Whether the growth removed from <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s intestine in 1992 was cancerous was not the only public questioning regarding <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s health into which Dr. Crucitti was drawn.

In 1996, after the operation to remove John Paul's appendix, Dr. Crucitti was asked about a trembling that noticeably affected <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP>'s left hand. 

The condition had given rise to speculation that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> was suffering from Parkinson's Disease or a related disorder.

Dr. Crucitti avoided giving a direct answer, but he acknowledged for the first time that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> was being treated for an ailment that he declined to discuss further. 

Since then, Vatican officials have confirmed that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> suffers from a form of Parkinson's.

Addressing a news conference after the appendectomy in 1996, Dr. Crucitti said, ''We have told <RP Category='POPE_TAG'>the <HR>Pope</HR></RP> to rest.'' 

Asked whether he believed that <RP Category='POPE_TAG'><HR>Pope</HR> John Paul</RP>, who continued to follow a grueling schedule, would heed that advice, Dr. Crucitti replied, ''Ah, now that remains to be seen.''
